# > Hi there I'm Mickayla ✨
Graphic designer and social media marketer pivoting to cybersecurity. I traded viral posts for vulnerability assessments and discovered I'd rather defend data than design campaigns.

Currently pursuing Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, with CompTIA Security+ next. This ever-evolving threat landscape fascinates me, and I'm committed to building the technical skills to protect against it.

Welcome to my profile, stick around to watch my journey from pixels to packets, pretty pictures to penetration testing.
